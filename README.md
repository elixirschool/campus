# Elixir School

Welcome to the Elixir School Campus, we're happy you decided to stop by!

Elixir School is a not-for-profit organization aimed at providing educational resources and opportunities to the Elixir community.  To achieve this goal we maintain a number of initiatives and continuously seek to identify needs in the community and fulfill them.

## Current initiatives

+ [Elixir School](https://github.com/elixirschool/elixirschool) — The original project from which our org takes it's name is a freely available open-source book translated to over 20 languages!  This is a major milestone for any tech book and it was made possible with the help of open-source contributors such as yourself!

## Core Values

+ Be Humble

+ Be Helpful

+ Be Happy — you're coding in Elixir after all!

## Contributing

Without contributions Elixir School wouldn't be what it is today and with help from people like you it'll only get better.  Whether you're a seasoned pro or a first-time contributor we're happy to have you.

Contributing to Elixir School can be rewarding not only for yourself but for everyone following along.  For this reason we believe that contributors to Elixir School should share our Core Values.  What we expect from our contributors:

+ To be helpful: Offer feedback in a constructive manner.  Don't just say something is wrong, help others understand how it could be better.

+ To be humble: We all bring different things to the table including experience.  Know something someone else doesn't?  Teach it to them!  There's no need to remind people what we know and they don't.  Conversely when someone provides you help be appreciative. 

+ To be happy: No one likes a downer.  Having a bad day?  Maybe today isn't the best day to comment on Pull Requests and that's okay!  You come first.

Does this sound like you?  Great!  Now that we know you want to contribute, let's talk about ways to get involved.

The best way to get started is to join the conversations taking place in Issues and Pull Requests for the different initiatives.  Whether it's discussing a bug or a feature, the greater degree of collaboration the better the end result; everyone can add or learn something.

As you interact with different projects you may find bugs or identify opportunities for improvements.  If you do, kick off the discussion by opening an Issue in the appropriate repository.  Once the Issue has been reviewed and it's decided there should be a change, it's yours if you want it!  If you don't think you can handle it, we're happy to help so you can!

Don't just stop with Elixir School!  Get involved in [Slack](https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/)/[IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=elixir-lang), give a talk at your local meetup, or find a project you use and give back.
